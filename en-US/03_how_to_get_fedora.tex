\chapter*{How to Get Fedora?}
\section*{Getting Fedora}

You can install Fedora from a USB flash drive, optical media (DVD), or over the network by using an appropriate installation image. Installation images of \emph{Fedora~Workstation} are available for download in the ISO format at \url{getfedora.org}. \emph{Fedora Workstation} defaults to a 64-bit operating system download as that is what is best for most users.

If you aren't ready to install Fedora yet and would like to try it first without losing or permanently changing anything on your PC, make sure you download a live image. With this image, you can boot to a~fully functional system and find out what Fedora is like, experiment with it, and determine whether it fully supports your PC's hardware.

To run \emph{Fedora Workstation} reasonably well it is recommend that you have at least a 1~GHz processor, 2~GiB of memory, 10~GiB of hard drive space, and a graphics card that supports hardware acceleration. These aren't the absolute minimum requirements, but they are the best for most users. Some users may wish to run Fedora on lower powered machines and will find it performs well on these, too.

\section*{Creating Installation Media}

In order to install or run Fedora from an installation image, you need to create installation media first:
\begin{itemize}
\item\emph{USB Installation} --- To create a USB installation drive, you can use the \emph{Fedora Media Writer}. It can run on \emph{MS Windows}, \emph{Apple macOS} or Linux. Beware---this program will erase all the data on the flash drive! \emph{Fedora Media Writer} can download the installation image and verify it's been correctly downloaded and really comes from the \emph{Fedora Project}. If you're using \emph{MS Windows} or \emph{Apple macOS}, the installation file of the application is what you'll be offered when you decide to download \emph{Fedora Workstation} at \url{getfedora.org}. The Linux version of \emph{Fedora Media Writer} can be found in the universal installation format \emph{Flatpak} at \url{flathub.org}.

As you can see in the picture, \emph{Fedora Media Writer} allows you to pick different flavors of \emph{Fedora}. We recommend you choose \emph{Fedora Workstation} since it's the default option for general desktop use, and it's the flavor this handbook is about.

Once you install \emph{Fedora Workstation}, you might want to reformat the USB drive to use it as data storage again. \emph{Fedora Media Writer} can do that for you as well.

\item\emph{DVD Installation} --- Using a DVD is a very traditional way of~installing Fedora. You can create an installation DVD by writing an ISO image to a DVD. Most modern operating systems can do this operation with built-in software. If not, you can install a specialized application such as \emph{Brasero} on Linux and \emph{ImgBurn} on \emph{MS Windows}. All versions of \emph{Apple macOS} can write DVDs using \emph{Finder} and \emph{Disk Utility}.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Installing Fedora}
\begin{enumerate}
\item\emph{Booting} --- No matter what media you've chosen, you'll need to make sure that you set the right boot sequence in the BIOS of the computer you'd like to install \emph{Fedora~Workstation} on. The drive with the install media needs to be in the first position. You can get to the BIOS configuration by pressing a specific key after starting the computer. The key depends on the vendor (typically the keys are \keystroke{Delete}, \keystroke{F1}, or \keystroke{F2}). Alternately, many vendors allow you to choose a boot drive without having to go to the BIOS settings by pressing the \keystroke{F12} key.

\item\emph{Initial Screen} --- After successfully booting from the installation media, you'll see the initial screen where you can choose between starting the \emph{Fedora~Workstation} live system and verifying the install media. If you choose starting the live system, you'll boot into the live system and will be asked if you want to try the system out or install it on the hard drive. If you choose to \enquote{Try Fedora} you can use it in this way for as long as you want and can choose to perform an installation at any time by clicking on the installer icon in the menu.

\end{figure}

\item\emph{Trying the System} --- If you've chosen to try the system, you'll begin using the \emph{GNOME~Shell}, a desktop environment. The top of the display contains the most commonly used control elements. There is an \emph{Activities} button in the upper left corner which will get you to applications (and to the option to install \emph{Fedora Workstation} on your system). The upper right corner has controls that allow you to set up the network, as well as to restart or shut down the system.

\item\emph{Installer} --- Once you decide to install \emph{Fedora Workstation}, go to \emph{Activities} and click the \emph{Install to Hard Drive} icon on the panel on the left. You'll being using the installation program, Anaconda. The installer consists of different screens that manage the options for areas such as language settings, time zone, etc.

The disk partitioning spoke is the most important part of the installer. This spoke will define where on your hard drive \emph{Fedora Workstation} will be installed. The installer offers you automatic partitioning which will configure the hard drive in a way that is useful for most people, or you can also choose manual partitioning and apply a customized setting. It is also possible to set up encryption for better security.

\emph{Fedora Workstation} also allows you to create a dual-boot system, that is, to have two operating systems installed on your PC at the same time. It's easy to install \emph{Fedora Workstation} next to an existing \emph{MS Windows} installation. If you do this, you will be able to choose which system to boot every time you restart your computer.

In the partitioning dialog, you will see the existing partitions on the left. Before you confirm the changes make sure that everything is the way you meant it to be (for example that all partitions of other operating systems are still there, if you wish to keep them). When you confirm the changes and start the installation, the changes will be final.

\item\emph{First boot} --- \emph{Fedora Workstation} Live installer doesn't require you to do anything while the system is being installed, so you can sit back or go to the kitchen to grab your favorite beverage. The whole installation should only take a few minutes.

Once the installation is finished you will be prompted to reboot. Don't forget to change the boot order to the original state before you boot into the freshly installed system.
\end{enumerate}

On the first boot after the installation you will be asked to create a user account and set several initial preferences. Note that the user account is automatically set to be able to switch to the admin mode to perform administrator tasks. If you want to use the traditional \emph{root} account, you have to enable it after you log into the system for the first time.

Everything worked well? Now you can start exploring \emph{Fedora Workstation}!
